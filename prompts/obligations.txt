Use step-by-step reasoning to extract all obligations from the document. Format the result in JSON:
{
  "obligations": [
    {
      "party": "Party Name",
      "obligation": "Obligation description"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
If no obligations are found, return {"obligations": []}.
Your entire response/output is going to consist of a single JSON object {}, and you will NOT wrap it within JSON markdown markers.
