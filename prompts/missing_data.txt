You are an expert in document analysis and reasoning. Carefully review the provided document to extract the missing categories of information. Use step-by-step reasoning to ensure a thorough analysis.

Here is the context:
1. The document has already been analyzed, and the following information have been extracted in form of JSON:
{{analysis_result}}
2. The analysis result should contain the following categories relevant for this document type: {{analysis_categories}}
3. However, the following categories were incomplete or undefined in the initial analysis:
{% for k, v in missing_data.items() %}
  - {{k}}: {{v}}
{% endfor %}

Focus only on extracting these missing categories: {{missing_categories}}

Rules:
1. Think step-by-step to ensure logical and complete extraction.
2. If you cannot confidently determine a category, state explicitly that the information is not present or you unable to extract/find it.
3. Return result in valid JSON format with keys corresponding to the missing categories.

Return your response in a valid JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "categories": {
    "risks": [
      "Potential legal disputes related to the property.",
      "Possible undisclosed defects in the property."
    ],
    "dates": [
      {"date": "2025-01-01", "details": "Execution deadline for the agreement"},
      {"date": "2025-01-02", "details": "Effective date"},
      ...
    ],
    ...
  },
  "missing_data": {
    "obligations": "is missing in analysis result",
    ...
  }
}

If cannot determine any categories, return {"categories": {}, "missing_data": {"category_name": "reason why it is missing"}}.

Your entire response/output is going to consist of a single JSON object {}, and you will NOT wrap it within JSON markdown markers.
